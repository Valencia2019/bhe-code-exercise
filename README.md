# BHE Software Engineer Coding Exercise

## Basics
Language chosen: Javascript
Focus: automated testing

## Installation and basic use
Steps to install:
1. Clone the repository.
2. In terminal run `npm i`
3. To start the server, in terminal run `npm run start`
4. To run all of the tests, in terminal run `npm run test`

## Coding Approach
I'm not as familiar with creating servers so I started with that first, assuming it would be harder to do than implementing a math problem. The API code is in the ./src/api folder. The tests are in ./tests folder. 

### Notes
The tests will take about 30 seconds to run. If you would like them to run in under 5, go to tests/sieve.test.js and comment out line 14.
